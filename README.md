# Discord-py-bot-issus

I'm new to python but I tried to make a dc bot.
I came across a issue that I had no idea how to solve.

The bot is supposed to respond to 3 msgs

"Hello" and reply with "Hello {user}"                
"Club tag" and reply with "#VCYJV99Q"               
"respond" and reply in dm with "**_responded_**"       

This all works serperately, but not all together.                      
What happens is, only the last event works. So if i list the @client.event in the same order as listed earlier, then only the "respond" would work and Idk why.
